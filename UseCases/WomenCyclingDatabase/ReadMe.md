# Use Case `Women Cycling Database`

## Intro
This is the first implemented use case in `PythonOpenSourceProject`.

It's main aim is the development of Open Source code using PostgreSQL.

## Steps

### 1. Database creation
In this first step, a database will be specified that will embed Cycling Women Elite races results for some period of time (e.g. season 2020). This specification will be done using SQL schemes. The creation of the database will then be done using a Python interface to PostgreSQL.


### 2. Database feeding
In this second step, data will be collected about Cycling road races results for Women Elite category. These data have been selected because they are not that much used up today, so their proposal on the Web mpight be of interest for fans.

This data will then be prepared (as CSV formatted data) and parsed to feed the database according to its specifications and using PostgreSQL Python API.


### 3. Database querying
Finally, in this third step querying this database will be implemented. The aim here is to use Web technologies for the querying interface and for the interactions with users. There, other technologies might be used, in conjunction with PostgreSQL. This will help augment the Open Source code.


## Next
It might be that next developments could be done using a no-sql database management system. This ccould be MongoDB for instance.
