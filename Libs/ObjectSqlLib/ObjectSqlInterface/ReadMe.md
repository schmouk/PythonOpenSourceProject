# Object SQL Interface

This sub-package of library `ObjectSqlLib` defines the interface that every object oriented programming SQL library should conform to. 

It is fully compliant with PEP 249 (Python Database API Specification v2.0, [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/)).

It helps creating relational databases and serving SQL requests in an OOP manner (*Object Oriented Programming*) with Python.
