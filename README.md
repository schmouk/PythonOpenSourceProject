# PythonOpenSourceProject
This project is currently under progress

## Notice
No push should be made on branch `main`. This branch is for the sole purpose of releases and is currently empty. Any developemtn **must** be made on branch `dev` from which **`merge requests`** may be generated. Admins are the only persons that are allowed to merge des from branch `dev` into branch `main`. Finally, it is strongly recommended to create personal branches from branch `dev` while implmeneting features (i.e. solving issues, as these are named in GitHub).
