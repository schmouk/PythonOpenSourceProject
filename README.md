# PythonOpenSourceProject
This project is currently under progress

## Introduction
This project aims at providing Open Source code for different technologies.

## Steps
As a first step, a simple statistical analysis of keywords associated with jobs descriptions will be done.

From these analytics, related technologies will be selected and Open Source code will be proposed here that will show or help the use of these technologies, in Python. Use cases will be proposed step after step, which will involve new technologies step after step also.

See directory `Documentation` to get infos about current developments, past developments and further developments.

## Python version
By Aug. 15, 2020 we decided to program with Python 3.9. Current release (since Aug. 11) is Python 3.9.0rc1 (release candidate 1). Python 3.9 is expected to be available by Oct. 8, 2020. It must be that by those days not all external libraries will be available as compatible with Python 3.9. We have nevertheless decided to start programming with Python 3.9 as soon as possible.

## Notice
No push should be made on branch `main`. This branch is for the sole purpose of releases and is currently empty. Any development **must** be made on branch `dev` from which **`merge requests`** may be generated. Admins are the only persons that are allowed to merge these from branch `dev` into branch `main`. Finally, it is strongly recommended that you create personal branches from branch `dev` while implementing features (i.e. solving issues, as these are named in GitHub).
